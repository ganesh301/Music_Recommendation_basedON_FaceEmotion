# Music Recommendation Based on Face Emotion Recognition

This project combines deep learning techniques, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for facial emotion recognition, with a filter-based music recommendation system. The system, implemented in Python using TensorFlow and OpenCV, detects the user's emotional state from their facial expressions and suggests personalized music recommendations accordingly.
